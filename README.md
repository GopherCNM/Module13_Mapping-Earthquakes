# Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs

## Overview of the project

For this project, we helped Basil and Sadhana from the Disaster Reporting Network, to create an interactive map showing recent earthquake data. Referencing GeoJSON data available on the US Geological Survey (USGS) website, we used JavaScript, D3, Leaflet, and Mapbox to plot the data using API requests. Our HTML file helped us to create a webpage to display our work, and to share with others.  

Building on the practice curriculum from the module, we made some additional modifications for this challenge.  

- Added an overlay for tectonic lines using a raw data set available on GitHub.  
- Created an additional overlay that shows only major earthquakes (4.5-magnitude+) over the past week. As with our initial earthquake map, the circle markers are color-coded, and the radii are scaled, to reflect the magnitude of the earthquakes.  
- Finally, we added another base map option using the “dark” option from Mapbox.
